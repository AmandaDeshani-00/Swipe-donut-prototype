# Swipe Animation - Donut Items 🍩
This prototype demonstrates a swipe animation interaction for a donut-themed UI, built in **Figma**.  
It was inspired by the YouTube tutorial: [Figma Tutorial: Swipe Animation / Prototyping Tutorial](https://youtu.be/3TkgS5WIFi4?si=lTxby_2vmFn0Ooa7).  
I also added some new items and variations based on the instructions for additional practice and creativity.
